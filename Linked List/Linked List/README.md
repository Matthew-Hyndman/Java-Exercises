# Linked List

## pros:
 - dynamic size
 - ease of insertion/deletion
## cons:
 - random access is not allowed (means we have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node)
 - extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list
 - not cache friendly, as elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations

 ## for this demo
 we will implement a simple linked list in Java, which supports basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
